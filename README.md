This project was created to pass [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram Challenge.


## Available Scripts

project [gh-page](https://alialghanay.github.io/treemap-diagram/).

## Project User Story 
### 1: 
My tree map should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.

### 2:
My tree map should have a description with a corresponding `id="description"`.

### 3:
My tree map should have `rect` elements with a corresponding `class="tile"` that represent the data.
### 4:
There should be at least 2 different fill colors used for the tiles.

### 5:
Each tile should have the properties `data-name`, `data-category`, and `data-value` containing their corresponding `name`, `category`, and `value`.

### 6:
 The area of each tile should correspond to the `data-value` amount: tiles with a larger `data-value` should have a bigger area.

### 7:
My tree map should have a legend with corresponding `id="legend"`.

### 8:
My legend should have `rect` elements with a corresponding `class="legend-item"`.

### 9:
The `rect` elements in the legend should use at least 2 different fill colors.

### 10:
 I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.

### 11:
My tooltip should have a `data-value` property that corresponds to the `data-value` of the active area.
